		Subtitle Batch Converter
	</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		My personal opinion of subtitles is that they should be unobtrusive, plain text only, and widely supported by hardware. This presents issues when using the subtitle tracks 
		found on BluRays - they're always image based PGS subs. I know of very few players that support playback of these - even my Nvidia Shield Pro won't play them (on Plex, on Kodi they work). 
		So my simple solution is to convert all subtitles to a format literally every player in the world understands: SRT.
		<br>
		<br>
		As far as this script in particular goes, there's a few caveats. The first glaring issue is that converting PGS subtitles to SRT requires using OCR. Generally when using OCR you need to 
		sit down and manually fix spelling & character errors, which I'm not because, well, I really don't want to do that for 1,000 movies. Some people would say it's a really bad idea to 
		[attempt to] automate OCR'ing, but I've found that with the program I use, when converting from PGS subtitles, 90% of the errors are due to just a couple of character issues. 
		You can see this in the script - there's some simple character replacements after OCR'ing. It doesn't make the subs perfect, but the way I see it, having 99% accurate subtitles is 
		good enough for me.
		<br>
		<br>
		The other issue is dealing with movies with multiple sub tracks. I only keep the English subtitles on movies I watch, which simplifies this issue because every movie will have at most 
		2 sub tracks - a "forced" track (with only foreign audio parts included), and a "full" track (with text for all speech). This script will convert all the sub tracks to SRT, but by default 
		will only mux in one of them to the container. I have so few movies with forced sub tracks that it's easier to just mux the second one in manually later (and set the flags appropriately).

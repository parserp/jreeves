	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>
		Recently I upgraded my TV size by a couple feet, and suddenly I realized that a good portion of the media on my server isn't actually as "HD" as I was led to believe. 
		This led me on a journey that ultimately is costing a dozen dollars a month in electricity usage: the quest for high quality, low bitrate movies.

	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>
		Before, I would "obtain" movies from several different sources. These varied quite a bit depending on where it came from, what codec was used, when it was encoded, etc. 
		I've always known that these weren't the best copies of the films out there, but to an extent I just didn't care because I didn't have a device that I could tell a difference on.
		<br>
		<br>
		Long story short, as I tested with videos of higher bitrate, there still was quite a variety of quality. As I dove more into what makes a good video encode, I realized that 
		the videos I had all had wildly different encoding settings. I imagine that some were even encoded from some other crappy encode. Naturally, the only logical place to go would be the 
		opposite end of the spectrum - wanting to have the highest quality video possible. This would be Blu-Ray discs, or remuxes (unaltered Blu-Ray material in an mkv container).
		<br>
		<br>
		Here is the catch: even with a sizeable pool of hard drives, I'm still constrained by my server's limited capacity. 
		I'd love to store remuxes only, but it adds up quickly - let's say the average remux is 25-26 GiB (this is a guess, but it's probably not far off). At a collection of 2,000 movies, 
		that's ~50 TiB. I wouldn't be able to dedicate that kind of storage solely to movies, so I decided to go with the next best thing: encoding videos myself from Blu-Ray remuxes. 
		This way, I could micromanage what I wanted regarding bitrates, encoding settings, etc., to give the "perfect" mix of quality to size ratio.

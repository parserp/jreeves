		Video Conversion Project - aka I hate my CPU
	</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>
		Recently I upgraded my TV size by a couple feet, and suddenly I realized that a good portion of the media on my server isn't actually as "HD" as I was led to believe. 
		This led me on a journey that ultimately is costing a dozen dollars a month in electricity usage: the quest for high quality, low bitrate movies. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>
		Before, I would "obtain" movies from several different sources. These varied quite a bit depending on where it came from, what codec was used, when it was encoded, etc. 
		I've always known that these weren't the best copies of the films out there, but to an extent I just didn't care because I didn't have a device that I could tell a difference on.
		<br>
		<br>
		Long story short, as I tested with videos of higher bitrate, there still was quite a variety of quality. As I dove more into what makes a good video encode, I realized that 
		the videos I had all had wildly different encoding settings. I imagine that some were even encoded from some other crappy encode. Naturally, the only logical place to go would be the 
		opposite end of the spectrum - wanting to have the highest quality video possible. This would be Blu-Ray discs, or remuxes (unaltered Blu-Ray material in an mkv container).
		<br>
		<br>
		Here is the catch: even with a sizeable pool of hard drives, I'm still constrained by my server's limited capacity. 
		I'd love to store remuxes only, but it adds up quickly - let's say the average remux is 25-26 GiB (this is a guess, but it's probably not far off). At a collection of 2,000 movies, 
		that's ~50 TiB. I wouldn't be able to dedicate that kind of storage solely to movies, so I decided to go with the next best thing: encoding videos myself from Blu-Ray remuxes. 
		This way, I could micromanage what I wanted regarding bitrates, encoding settings, etc., to give the "perfect" mix of quality to size ratio.
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<h2>Deciding on encoding settings</h2>
	<p>
		This was the most difficult part of the project, because while there are some absolutes in video encoding, settings that are very similar can look different to each set of eyes - 
		so there's a variety of opinions when it comes to what the "best" settings are. That being said, the settings I use are intended to get an overall good result when batch encoding 
		many movies, and for each individual movie, there are settings that could be tweaked to get a better individual result. I don't have time to figure that out for each movie, so 
		getting a good batch encode is going to be my next best bet.
		<br>
		<br>
		One of the biggest first choices was which codec to use. I went with H.265, mostly by process of elimination. H.264 I ruled out because the bitrate required for a great encode was too much to swallow. 
		AV1 I ruled out because while it is an awesome codec, at the time of writing (2022) hardware support is far from the norm. It also takes an incredible amount of time to encode. H.266 is so far out that 
		it's not worth considering (plus, FFmpeg won't have a library for it for a while). H.265 encoding is slow, especially for the settings I use, but it's good enough. It also has pretty good hardware 
		decoding support across most platforms.
		<br>
		<br>
		Diving further into the encoding settings themselves, the lines start to become blurred between fact and opinion. I'll probably state some things as facts that are far from it - just be aware that my 
		encoding settings work pretty well for my use case, and not all principles can be applied to a project with different variables. Anyway, the two big settings I went with right off the bat were 10 bit HEVC, 
		and using a CRF value instead of a target bitrate with either 1 or 2 passes. This is generally considered best practice, as target bitrate introduces problems of its own depending on the content. 
		<br>
		<br>
		With other settings beyond a CRF value, I tried to have as few as possible because [in my opinion] the HEVC developers did a pretty good job making the vanilla encoding settings work well on 
		most videos. The only one that I felt strongly enough about its impact to include was disabling SAO (a tool used to smooth objects out) on animated content. Beyond that, since I'm strictly 
		doing batch encoding of remuxes, it seemed having good general settings would be better than diving in to which option gives the best result on a specific movie.
		<br>
		<br>
		That's enough info (and disclaimers) to get to the really cool part, the automation! Granted, it's just a simple Python script, but it does the job well. This script was writton on Windows, it could be easily 
		modified to work on Mac/Linux.

	<h2>Figuring out CRF and encoding speed</h2>
	<p>
		The FFmpeg HEVC documentation states "<i>Use the slowest preset you have patience for.</i>". Based off of a few opinions on message boards, I decided on the 'slow' preset. It gives enough 
		advantages over 'medium' and 'fast', while not having an unnecessarily long encode time. 
	<br>
	<br>
		The last factor is the CRF value to use for HEVC. This has a variety of opinions. For example, these are some of the things I've heard (some may be more factual than others):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>From the FFmpeg documentation: "<i>The default is 28, and it should visually correspond to libx264 video at CRF 23, but result in about half the file size.</i>"</li>
		<li>'Visually Lossless' for H.264 occurs at about CRF 18</li>
		<li>CRF for HEVC equals CRF for H.264 plus 2</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Some of those statements seem to contradict each other, so I set out to do my own research on the matter. Testing out on a subset of 10 movies, I honestly couldn't tell a visual difference 
		between anything of CRF < 20-21. I could just set everything at CRF 19 and forget about it, but I wanted to give a little bit of wiggle room for those whose eyes are better than mine. 
		So I decided to look at it from a storage perspective - because after all, my space is limited. At CRF 19, the average video bitrate within my [small] subset was ~8Mbps. 
		After a few calculations based on the storage space I have and how large of a movie collection I'd like to be able to handle, I came up with a fairly reasonable number of allocating 10GiB 
		per movie. Let's do the math here: Overestimating a little bit, the average movie is 2 hours. 10GiB/2 hours equals an overall bitrate of 11,651 Kbps. Subtracting out 1509 kbps for a DTS track and 
		a hundred or so kbps for subtitles/overhead, we are left with ~10Mbps for the video stream. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<h2>Execution: putting the theory into practice</h2>
	<p>
		So 10Mbps is the target bitrate for my movies. Obviously not every movie is going to come out to exactly that bitrate with CRF encoding, so I went with a range of acceptable bitrates. 
		The workflow currently looks like this:
	</p>
	<ul class="listarrow">
		<li>Encode movies at CRF 16 for movies made after the year 2000, and at CRF 18 for movies made before the year 2000. (As a generality, CRF 16 works better for movies that are more 
		likely to be digitally shot. It's only accurate about half the time)</li>
		<li>If the video bitrate is 7000kbps < bitrate < 13000kbps, great! This movie encode is complete.</li>
		<li>If it doesn't fall within that range, change the CRF to get it within that range, with a minimum CRF of 14 and a maximum CRF of 22.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		There are some that still fall out of the 7-13 Mbps range even when the CRF is tweaked. For movies that are too small at CRF 14, I leave them be. No reason to complain about that! 
		For movies that are still > 13Mbps at CRF 22, I still don't have a great solution. Out of about 250 movies that I've encoded using this method, maybe 10 or so fall into that category. 
		A great example of this is the movie <i>12 Angry Men (1957)</i>. Even at CRF 24 (over what I'd like the CRF to be), the video bitrate sits at 17Mbps. I may try to figure out some 
		reasonable H.264 encoding settings for edge cases like this at some future point.
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<h2>Encoding time: The Achilles heel?</h2>
	<p>
		Given that I want the best possible encode of these remuxes, I'm forced to use pure CPU encoding, with no hardware acceleration enabled on either the CPU or GPU. 
		This presents a possible problem: is encoding >1000 movies to HEVC on the 'slow' preset actually feasible? I just happened to have a Ryzen 9 3950X laying around, 
		which has become the main CPU used on this project. With 16 cores, it takes 2-3 simultaneous encodes to keep it at 100% continuous usage. The instantaneous encoding 
		speed at any given time can range from an aggregate of 0.5 speed to 1.2 speed (this means that if I have 3 encodes all running at 0.3 speed, the aggregate encode speed 
		is 0.9).
		<br>
		<br>
		In the last batch of 100 movies I encoded, it took nearly exactly 10 days to finish encoding. This means that my average encoding time per movie hovers at about 2.4 hours. 
		The thorn in my side in all of this is that the assumption of CRF 16 and 18 only winds up being within the target bitrate range ~45% of the time (this is the best result I could get. 
		Original guesses at other CRF values were only in the target bitrate range 30% of the time). 55% of all movies require a second 
		encode at a modified CRF. So, unfortunately, that 10 days for 100 movies suddenly becomes 15.5 days to get encodes that are all within the bitrate constraints.
		That makes for a calculated encoding time of 3.72 hours per movie.
		<br>
		<br>
		My movie library currently sits at ~1500 movies. Doing the math at 3.72 hours per movie, the total encoding time on my Ryzen is 232.5 days, excluding overhead. 
		That's about 8 months. Is it way longer than I would prefer? Yes. Is it attainable? Absolutely. As of the time of writing this, I'm about 1.5 months into the project, 
		with no regrets (so far).
	</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		I think that my solution for encoding movies is a pretty good compromise between storage space and video quality. There are still a LOT of movies left to encode before I can wrap this project up, 
		but after the initial setup and research, it's fairly automated and I don't need to focus so much attention on it. Now if only I could acquire a lot more CPUs to do encoding with...

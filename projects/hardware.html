	<h2>Hardware is listed from top to bottom.</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Switch - Aruba S2500-24P PoE</h2>
	<p>
		I purchased this switch in particular for 3 reasons: 1) All ports have PoE capabilities, 2) There are 4 SFP+ ports, and 3) it was under $100. 
		Beyond that, it's largely the same as most L3 switches. At some point I'll make the jump to fiber on the 10G links, but I'm not in any hurry because the DAC 
		copper cables work just fine, considering all the 10G switching is done within the rack itself. One of the biggest gripes that I have about this switch 
		(and lots of enterprise equipment in general), is that you're vendor locked on the types of cables you can use. I wound up getting some molex DACs that worked.

	<h2>Router - Mikrotik RB4011iGS+RM</h2>
	<p>
		I was hesitant at the high price point about this, but I'm honestly sold now on Mikrotik. I've never had an issue with the hardware since I bought it ~1 year ago, 
		and RouterOS is an amazing tool (though with a bit of a learning curve). Between various projects, I route between 20-30 TiB of data per month, 
		which equates to an average use of ~65-97 Mbps average constant load. On top of this I've got several firewall and filter rules (not a ton), 
		and the overall CPU/RAM usage is about 10%. Currently I'm on symmetric gigabit fiber from my ISP, I'd love to go for 10G at some point. Unfortunately, 
		10G plans are over $200/month so I just can't justify the cost... yet.

		A brief overview of the hardware I run
	</h1>

	<br>
	<h2>Hardware is listed from top to bottom.</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Switch - Aruba S2500-24P PoE</h2>
	<p>
		I purchased this switch in particular for 3 reasons: 1) All ports have PoE capabilities, 2) There are 4 SFP+ ports, and 3) it was under $100. 
		Beyond that, it's largely the same as most L3 switches. At some point I'll make the jump to fiber on the 10G links, but I'm not in any hurry because the DAC 
		copper cables work just fine, considering all the 10G switching is done within the rack itself. One of the biggest gripes that I have about this switch 
		(and lots of enterprise equipment in general), is that you're vendor locked on the types of cables you can use. I wound up getting some molex DACs that worked.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Router - Mikrotik RB4011iGS+RM</h2>
	<p>
		I was hesitant at the high price point about this, but I'm honestly sold now on Mikrotik. I've never had an issue with the hardware since I bought it ~1 year ago, 
		and RouterOS is an amazing tool (though with a bit of a learning curve). Between various projects, I route between 20-30 TiB of data per month, 
		which equates to an average use of ~65-97 Mbps average constant load. On top of this I've got several firewall and filter rules (not a ton), 
		and the overall CPU/RAM usage is about 10%. Currently I'm on symmetric gigabit fiber from my ISP, I'd love to go for 10G at some point. Unfortunately, 
		10G plans are over $200/month so I just can't justify the cost... yet.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Supermicro 2U Chassis</h2>
	<p>
		This is the most hodge-podge aspect of my rack - I bought the chassis with some outdated motherboard on a surplus clearance sale, and tossed the motherboard. 
		What did I replace it with? A slightly less sucky motherboard I bought from another surplus sale, of course! Specs:
	</p>
	<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
	<li>Lenovo proprietary motherboard</li>
	<li>Core i7-4490</li>
	<li>16 GB DDR3 1600Mhz</li>
	<li>128GB SSD (boot drive, I had it laying around)</li>
	<li>2TB Crucial SSD (used as temp storage & working directory)</li>
	<li>10G networking card (SFP+ DAC connected to switch)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		So... a little underpowered, but it works for what I use it for. The 3 fans in the mid wall are Nidec Ultraflow V80E12BHA5-57, 
		which are the same as the 4U chassis, but I've never had a problem with the noise level, even with the cpu under 100% load.
		This box operates as my main seedbox, and it runs all of my backup scripts (mostly .bat files run nightly, Rclone to backup to GDrive).
